# Slide scanner
Automatic slide scanning with a DSLR and a slide projector for fast and easy scanning of traditional 35mm slides. The system consists of several standard components that are tied together by an interface box with control software. All hardware is precisely lined up at an optical bench for optimal and parallax free transfers. All mounted 35mm slides are placed in a Kodak Slide tray and the number of slides is selected in the control software. 

For those who have the basic components in their studio, it is only necessary to add the interface board and software in order to get started if you own a digital camera, slide projector, bellows and lens.
